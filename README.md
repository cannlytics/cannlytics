## 🏫 Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Cannlytics is a healthy mix of user friendly interfaces and software that you can use in your cannabis-testing lab. Users do not have to have any advanced knowledge and can jump in at any point. There are many advanced features that people with background in the web stack, Python, or your favorite programming language can jump right into.

The Cannlytics Website provides people with information about Cannlytics. The Cannlytics Engine is a mobile, desktop, and web app that provides administrators, laboratory staff, laboratory clients, and client integrators to interact with laboratory information.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

The `cannlytics` package is the core module implementing cannabis analytics logic. The `cannlytics` module handles database interactions, file management, authentication and authorization, traceability, data importing and exporting, and the logic for all workflows, such as certificate creation, item transfers, and publishing results.

The `cannlytics_api` is the interface between the user's application and the cannabis analytics logic of `cannlytics`.

The `cannlytics_console` is the user application where user's can interface with the infrastructure, such as the database, and utilize the cannabis analytics logic.

## 📖 Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Cannlytics is an open box and transparent. You do not have to guess about the software used in the Cannlytics Engine. Cannlytics is built and depends on the following software and services.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/psf/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Firebase Tools](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)
* [Google Cloud SDK](https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
* [Javascript, HTML, CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/about/)
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/about/)

Our philosophy is that open source and free solutions are the best. ["'Free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'"](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) See the [installation guide](/installation) for complete instructions. The installation instructions will guide you through:

1. Cloning the Cannlytics Engine.
2. Setting your account credentials.
3. Installing Python, Python dependencies, and all development tools.

A good place to begin is to clone the repository and get a lay of the architecture.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics_website.git
```
## 🏛️ Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

The Cannlytics Website is built with [Python] using the [Django] framework. The Cannlytics Website runs on [Cloud Run] and is hosted with [Firebase Hosting]. The Cannlytics Website utilizes [Firebase Authentication], an optional SQL database, a [Firestore] NoSQL database for real-time data management, and [Firebase Storage] for file storage. The Cannlytics Engine has a user interface that is built with [Flutter] and [Dart] with a backend powered by [Python].

Cannlytics users can swap out components for others. For example, Cannlytics users can swap out [Leaf] integration for [METRC] integration. Separating your choice of each component from another, Cannlytics frees users to choose combinations that suits them, freeing adminstrators and developers to focus on their preferred area of specialization.

For backing services, the Cannlytics Website utilizes several Google Cloud service, including:

  * Containerized using [Cloud Build]
  * Uploaded to [Cloud Registry]
  * Runs as a stateless container on [Cloud Run]
  * *Optional* [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) can be utilized if desired.
  * Additional [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) buckets can be used for file storage.
  * [Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/) is used for storing configurations and keeping secrets secret.

## 🛡️ Authentication <a name="authentication"></a>

When you are ready to begin working, then you will need to setup your authorization.

Resources:

* [Firebase Custom Authentication System with Django](https://medium.com/@gabriel_gamil/firebase-custom-authentication-system-with-django-c411009ddb44)
* [Django with Google Firebase](https://hackanons.com/2018/03/python-django-with-google-firebase-getting-started-intro-basic-configuration-firebase-authentication-part1.html)

## 🔨 Development <a name="development"></a>

See [the development guide](https://cannlytics.com/dev) for a full-guide. Development can happen in many avenues. Principally, clone the repository, create a fork, work on your desired problem, and finally create a pull request for your changes.

### 📡 Data <a name="data"></a>

Cannlytics operates with a NoSQL database, Firebase by default, however, can be configured with any SQL database.

Resources:

* [Django Database API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/)

### 📁 Storage <a name="storage"></a>

Cannlytics utilizes Firebase Storage / Google Cloud Storage for most storage solutions.

* [Serving static files on App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/serving-static-files)

### 🐞 Bugs <a name="bugs"></a>

See [bugs](https://cannlytics.com/bugs) for a full list of bugs and issues that you may encounter. Below are noteworthy bugs that you may encounter and their solutions.

- [Error: Can't Use Google Cloud Storage in Google Cloud Functions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52249978/write-to-google-cloud-storage-from-cloud-function-python/52250030)

  > **Solution** - If you are using Firebase Storage in a Google Cloud Function, then you need to specify `google-cloud-storage` in your `requirements.txt`.

* [Error: Firebase Hosting Base Rewrite Not Working](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44871075/redirect-firebase-hosting-root-to-a-cloud-function-is-not-working)

  > **Solution** - In order to use a rewrite at the root in Firebase Hosting, you must not include an `index.html` file in the public folder.

## ⚗️ Testing <a name="testing"></a>

Please see [the testing guide](https://cannlyitcs.com/docs/testing) for full documentation on Cannlytics software testing. Generally, you can run tests for an app, e.g. `app_name` as follows.

```
python manage.py test app_name
```

The Cannlytics Website can be built locally for testing:

```shell
docker build . --tag gcr.io/cannlytics/cannlytics-website
gcloud auth configure-docker
docker push gcr.io/cannlytics/cannlytics-website
```

## 📚 Publishing <a name="publishing"></a>

See [the publishing guide](https://cannlytics.com/publishing) for complete instructions on how to publish the Cannlytics Engine for use. Publishing is done with one command:

```shell
npm run publish
```

The build process contains three steps:

1. Containerize the app and upload it to Container Registry.

Build your container image using Cloud Build by running the following command from the directory containing the Dockerfile:

`gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/cannlytics/cannlytics-website`

2. Deploy the container image to Cloud Run.

`gcloud beta run deploy cannlytics-website --image gcr.io/cannlytics/cannlytics-website --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated --service-account=${GCS_SA}`

3. Direct hosting requests to the containerized app.

This step provides access to this containerized app from a [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) URL, so the app can generate dynamic content for the Firebase-hosted site.

`firebase deploy --only hosting:production`

## 🕵️ Administration <a name="administration"></a>

*Admin Site*

* Get an admin password with `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret admin_password && echo ""`

*User Authentication*
