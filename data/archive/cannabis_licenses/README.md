repo = 'cannlytics/cannabis_licenses'
dataset = load_dataset(repo, 'all')
data = dataset['data']
```

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

Data about organizations operating in the cannabis industry for each state is valuable for research.

### Data Collection and Normalization

In the `algorithms` directory, you can find the algorithms used for data collection. You can use these algorithms to recreate the dataset. First, you will need to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/cannlytics/cannabis_licenses
```

You can then install the algorithm Python (3.9+) requirements:

```
cd cannabis_licenses
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run all of the data-collection algorithms:

```
python algorithms/main.py
```

Or you can run each algorithm individually. For example:

```
python algorithms/get_licenses_ca.py
```

### Personal and Sensitive Information

This dataset includes names of individuals, public addresses, and contact information for cannabis licensees. It is important to take care to use these data points in a legal manner.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

Arguably, there is substantial social impact that could result from the study of permitted adult-use cannabis, therefore, researchers and data consumers alike should take the utmost care in the use of this dataset.

### Discussion of Biases

Cannlytics is a for-profit data and analytics company that primarily serves cannabis businesses. The data are not randomly collected and thus sampling bias should be taken into consideration.

### Other Known Limitations

The data is for adult-use cannabis licenses. It would be valuable to include medical cannabis licenses too.
