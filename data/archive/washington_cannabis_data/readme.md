## Dataset Description

- **Repository:** <https://huggingface.co/datasets/cannlytics/cannabis_sales>
- **Point of Contact:** <dev@cannlytics.com>

### Dataset Summary

This dataset is a collection of Washington State cannabis traceability data that is in the public domain.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is partitioned as follows.

| Subset | Description | Number of Observations |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| `washington-2023-01` | Cannabis sales items in Washington State in January of 2023. | 81,768 |

### Data Instances

You can load the `data` for each of the dataset files. For example:

```py
from datasets import load_dataset

# Download sales data for January 2023.
dataset = load_dataset('cannlytics/cannabis_sales', 'washington-2023-01')
data = dataset['data']
assert len(data) > 0
print('Downloaded %i observations.' % len(data))
```

> Note: Data is requested through [a public records](https://lcb.wa.gov/records/make-public-records-request) request on the 21st of each month. Data is typically through the first week of the month. Data processing can take up to 1 week. Therefore, the latest month's data is likely incomplete until the end of the following month and data processing has occurred.

### Data Splits

The data is split by state and month, e.g. `washington-2023-01`. 

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

Cannabis sales data is of interest to many parties and having a public repository of cannabis sales data could help data scientist in their endeavors.

### Source Data

| Data Source | URL |
|-------------|-----|
| WSLCB PRR 2023-03-06 | <https://lcb.app.box.com/s/l9rtua9132sqs63qnbtbw13n40by0yml> |
| WSLCB PRR 2023-01-27 | <https://lcb.box.com/s/wzfoqysl4v9aqljwc0pi0g5ea6bch759> |

#### Data Collection and Normalization

You can recreate the dataset using the open source algorithms in the repository. First clone the repository:

```
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/cannlytics/cannabis_sales
```

You can then install the requirements:

```
cd cannabis_sales
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run all of the data collection algorithms:

```
python algorithms/main.py
```

Or you can run each algorithm individually. For example:

```
python algorithms/washington_sales.py
```

In the `algorithms` directory, you can find the data collection scripts described in the table below.

| Algorithm |  State | Description | 
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `washington_sales.py` | WA | Curate Washington State cannabis sales items. |

<!-- | Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ccrs_sales_by_licensee.py` | Calculate `total_price`, `total_discount`, `total_sales_tax`, and `total_other_tax` by `licensee_id` by `date`. |
| `upload_ccrs_stats.py` | Calculate CCRS statistics and upload the statistics to Firestore (*Under development*). | -->

### Personal and Sensitive Information

The dataset includes public addresses and contact information for related cannabis licensees. It is important to take care to use these data points in a legal manner.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

Arguably, there is substantial social impact that could result from the study of cannabis, therefore, researchers and data consumers alike should take the utmost care in the use of this dataset.

### Discussion of Biases

Cannlytics is a for-profit data and analytics company that primarily serves cannabis businesses. The data are not randomly collected and thus sampling bias should be taken into consideration.

### Other Known Limitations

The dataset presumably has missing data and errors.
