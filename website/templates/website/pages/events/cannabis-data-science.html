  What is Cannabis Data Science?

  The group is a place for people in the cannabis industry or who have an interest in data science, or both, to meetup and talk about insights each other may have gleamed. In a typical meetup, we first we find public cannabis data, then we ask a scientific question, then we apply methods and theory to test our hypothesis. At the end we discuss our findings and any insights that we may have uncovered.

  Data science is essentially applying the scientific method
  to datasets in attempts to draw conclusions.

  Cannabis Data Science is my absolute fav Meetup. It's data science topped with economics and cannabis without pushy personalities or presumptions basically :) This is coming from a former (and forever haha) scientist and researcher who has had the pleasure of misbehaving and sometimes confounding data. While cannabis remains at the top accelerating industries of all time, customer and business data continues to roll in quicker than they can be deciphered.

  Cannabis Data Science not only keeps me sane and in tune with data analytics, - it's a place where I can ask tough questions to a knowledge-thirsty group whose career and field experiences enrich and challenge me. I live for the state-by-state comparisons but I keep coming back for the discussions of predictive models distilled with as much pragmatism as possible. Other than Cannabis Data Science, I don't know of anything else that leverages publicly available and new data to forecasting variables in the cannabis market. And it's not sink-or-swim either: Keegan the host equips you with open source code and instructions to analyze the data, so you can get out of it what you want. Fun times for me.
