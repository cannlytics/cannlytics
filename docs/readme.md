Cannlytics is simple, easy-to-use, **end-to-end** cannabis analytics software designed to make your data and information accessible. Cannlytics makes cannabis analysis **simple** and **easy** through data accessibility. We believe that everyone in the cannabis industry should be able to access rich, valuable data quickly and easily and that you will be better off for it. This documentation covers the Cannlytics architecture and how to build, develop, and publish the [Cannlytics Platform](https://console.cannlytics.com). You can view a published copy of the documentation at <https://docs.cannlytics.com>.

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, then you can quickly start with:

```shell
npm run start
```

## üå± Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Documentation for the project is written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and utilizes [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for building and development. The configuration for the documentation is contained within `mkdocs.yml` and the Python requirements are specified in `requirements.txt`.

1. Ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and open.
2. Install a local copy of [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) as follows.

After you have Docker installed, you can pull and build a copy of the Material for MKDocs image:

```shell
docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material
docker build -t squidfunk/mkdocs-material .
```

If you have Node.js installed, then you can use the command:

```shell
npm run install
```

Before you publish your docs to Firebase Hosting, you will need to create a `.firebaserc` file that looks like:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "your-project"
  },
  "targets": {
    "your-project": {
      "hosting": {
        "docs": [
          "your-project-docs"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üî® Development <a name="development"></a>

Once setup, you can preview the documentation as you write:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v "%cd%":/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material
```

If you have Node.js installed, then you can use the command:

```shell
npm run docs
```

> Note that there is [a namespace conflict between `django-livereload-server` and `livereload`](https://gist.github.com/hangtwenty/f53b3867db1e33780505ccafd8d2eef0), so you need to be careful when and where you install Python requirements. If you run into a `django-livereload-server` import error, first check that `PRODUCTION = False` in your `console/settings.py` and then follow [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/hangtwenty/f53b3867db1e33780505ccafd8d2eef0) to uninstall `livereload` and reinstall  `django-livereload-server`.

## üöÄ Publishing <a name="publishing"></a>

When you are ready, you can build the documentation:


```shell
mkdocs build
```

If you have Node.js installed, then you can use the command:

```shell
npm run build
```

You can publish the documentation to Firebase Hosting with:

```shell
firebase deploy --project your-project --only hosting:docs
```

If you have Node.js installed, then you can use the command:

```shell
npm run publish
```
