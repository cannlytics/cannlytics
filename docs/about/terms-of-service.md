You own your material that you create and share on our Services. You keep all rights to your material, but you must give us the legal permission we need to provide the Services. When you share, post or upload material, for example certificates, photos, or videos, that is covered by intellectual property rights, on or in connection with our services, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your material for the purpose of making Cannlytics' services and products available.

We aim to run the latest stable release of the software.
