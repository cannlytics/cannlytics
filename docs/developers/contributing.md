# Contributing

<!-- ## Become a Sponsor

Open source projects take time and money. Help support the project by becoming a sponsor. You can add your support at
any tier you feel comfortable with. No amount is too little. We also accept one time contributions via PayPal.

## Begin an Issue

The first place to begin contributing is to identify an issue that you can help with. You can find issues that need help by looking at the [issues page](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/issues). For quick questions, you can contact a developer at <admin@cannlytics.com>.

1. Please **don't hesitate** before asking your question through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/issues), unless the bug is security related and then you should email <dev@cannlytics.com> directly and do not create an issue.

2. When creating an issue on the repository, please provide as much info as possible:

    - Version being used.
    - Operating system.
    - Version of Python.
    - Errors in console.
    - Detailed description of the problem.
    - Examples for reproducing the error.  You can post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce
      the issue, then please provide the text in a plain text format for easy copy/paste.

    The more information provided, the greater the chance that someone will be able to answer, implement, or fix your issue in a timely manner.

3. Please be prepared to potentially field follow-up questions or provide additional information.
<!-- 
## Reviewing Code

You are welcome to take part in reviewing pull requests and/or reviewing direct commits. Please feel free to make suggestions to improve the code and discuss
solutions to overcome weaknesses in the software.

## Answering Questions Asked in Issues

When you are answering questions put forward in issues, indicate that you have seen the questions and give a minimal description of how you may begin to answer the question. Then, follow up with a thorough answer to the question or request more information if needed. Feel free to share your experience to help others out.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome, and a great way to help fix bugs and add new features. If you are interested in directly
contributing to the code base, then please see the [development guide](/about/dev/development/) for more information on the environment and process.

## Documentation Improvements

A ton of time has been spent not only creating and supporting this tool and related extensions, but also spent making
this documentation. If you want a good place to contribute, then you are welcome to help improve the documentation. The [development guide](/about/dev/development/) has more details about improving the documentation. -->

<!-- ### Have a question or problem?

For quick questions there's no need to open an issue as you can reach us at <dev@cannlytics.com>. -->

## Add a feature

You can request new features by [submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics/issues).
If you would like to implement a new feature, then you are welcome to submit an issue for your work first, so other Cannlytics contributors can be aware of your efforts. Please consider what kind of change you are proposing:

* For a **major feature**, we kindly request that you initiate a conversation by opening an issue. This would allow us to discuss your wonderful ideas in-depth. Doing so facilitates better coordination amongst all contributors, ensures we avoid redundant efforts, and assists you in shaping the proposal so that it seamlessly fits into the project. Your proactive approach to collaboration is genuinely appreciated.

* For **small features and bugs** you're welcome to craft and submit directly as a Pull Request. We sincerely value every contribution. However, please understand that while we'd love to incorporate every feature, inclusion in the `main` branch will be based on the broader benefit to the project and our cherished community. Your understanding and continued support mean a lot to us.

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we
need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to expedite the process, please provide as much information as you can as to how to recreate the bug. We may not be able to investigate / fix bugs that we can not reproduce.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

When you are ready to start your contribution, follow these 3 steps.

1. **Development**: [Fork the project](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo), set up the [development environment](/about/dev/development/),
  make your changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to
  your commits.

2. **Build**: Before submitting a pull request, [build the project](./publishing.md). Being able to build the project is
  a mandatory requirement for your PR to get accepted, as the project should at
  all times be installable through [GitHub](https://github.com/cannlytics/cannlytics).

3. **Pull Request**: After building the project, make a final commit, push
  your branch to GitHub and [send a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to `cannlytics:main`. If we
  suggest changes, then please make the required updates, rebase your branch and push the
  changes to your GitHub repository, which will automatically update your PR.

After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository. Thank you for growing Cannlytics ðŸŒ±
