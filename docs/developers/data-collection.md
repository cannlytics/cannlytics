# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Data Collection

As an organization, Cannlytics is committed to promoting transparency, reproducibility, and verifiability in cannabis data generation and collection. This SOP outlines the systematic procedure for collecting, processing, and managing data pertaining to cannabis licenses, lab results, strains, and sales. This data serves as the foundation for our informative and analytical offerings. 

## Purpose

The SOP will guide you through the procedure to collect, standardize, and archive cannabis data pertaining to licenses, lab results, strain data, and sales information. The procedure is intended to improve the robustness, reliability, and reproducibility of the data collected. We believe that this procedure will result in more value, accessibility, and dependability for our users.

## Procedure

The procedure for data collection is segmented into sections, corresponding to the dimensions of data being collected. The sections are:

- Cannabis Licenses
- Cannabis Lab Results
- Cannabis Strains
- Cannabis Sales

### Cannabis Licenses

The team will collect data on all US cannabis licenses on a weekly basis. The data sources to be utilized include regulatory bodies, online databases, and other reliable industry sources. Data collection will occur every Monday and will cover any updates from the previous week.

Data on international cannabis licenses will be collected annually.
The collection will occur during the first week of January, covering updates from the previous year. Reliable international databases, global regulatory bodies, and industry sources will be utilized for data collection.

### Cannabis Lab Results

Lab results from certain states will be collected on a daily to weekly basis depending on the volume and availability of data. Data sources will include laboratories, industry databases, and regulatory bodies. States where daily lab result collection is possible include:

- California
- Connecticut
- Florida
- Massachusetts

The team will conduct daily checks for new data. If data volume is substantial, collection will occur daily. Otherwise, a weekly collection will take place every Monday.

Lab results from certain states will be collected on a monthly basis. Data collection will occur on the first day of each month.
Data sources will include laboratories, industry databases, and the state's regulatory body. States where monthly lab result collection is possible include:

- Washington

### Cannabis Strains

Strain data is collected on the assumption that strains loosely correspond to the underlying chemical composition of cannabis. Therefore, strain data is primarily derived from cannabis lab test results.

Strain updates will be scheduled following the lab results updates. If lab results are updated daily, the strain data will also be updated daily. If lab results are updated weekly, strain updates will follow suit.

A small dataset of patent data related to cannabis strains will be collected monthly. Collection will occur on the first Monday of each month. The team will use patent databases and industry sources for this data collection.

### Cannabis Sales

Cannabis sales data will be collected on a monthly basis. This will occur during the first week of each month, covering the sales of the previous month. The team will collect data from industry databases, sales platforms, and regulatory reports.

## Data Validation and Quality Control

All collected data must undergo a validation process to ensure accuracy and reliability. A sample of the curated data should be manually validated against the data sources. Any discrepancies found should be flagged for further investigation.

## Data Archiving

All data will be stored in secure, encrypted databases, cloud file storage, local computer hard drives, and external hard drives when possible. The archiver should adhere to all relevant laws, company privacy policies, and industry-best security practices.

## Review and Update

This SOP should be reviewed annually to ensure its alignment with evolving industry standards and the company's objectives. Semantic versioning will be used when making changes to this SOP. When an update is made, the version number will be incremented according to the scale and significance of the change.
