Introduction
The Cannabis Data Collection SOP-0002, outlines the systematic procedure of collecting, processing, and managing data pertaining to cannabis licenses, lab results, strains, and sales. This data serves as the foundation for our app's informative and analytical features.

Purpose
As an organization, Cannlytics is committed to promoting transparency, reproducibility, and verifiability in cannabis data generation and collection. This SOP is designed to ensure the robustness and reliability of the data collected, which in turn bolsters the value and dependability of our app for users.

Procedure
The procedure for data collection is segmented into four sections, corresponding to the four dimensions of data being collected.

Cannabis Licenses

Weekly: Collect data on all US cannabis licenses.
Annually: Gather data on international cannabis licenses during the first week of January.
Cannabis Lab Results

Daily to weekly: Obtain lab results from California, Connecticut, Florida, and Massachusetts. Adjust the frequency based on volume and availability of data.
Monthly: Collect lab results from Washington on the first day of each month.
Cannabis Strains

As per lab results updates: Curate cannabis strains based on lab results data. Update frequency should mirror that of lab results.
Monthly: Collect a small dataset of patent data related to cannabis strains on the first Monday of each month.
Cannabis Sales

Monthly: Collect cannabis sales data by state during the first week of each month.
For all data, validate its accuracy by cross-checking with multiple sources and flagging discrepancies for further investigation. Store collected data in secure, encrypted databases, adhering to all relevant laws and company privacy policies.

Training
Those responsible for data collection should be thoroughly trained in these procedures and the specific tools and databases used. They should review this SOP periodically and demonstrate proficiency in data collection, validation, and management before undertaking these tasks.

Review and Update
This SOP should be reviewed annually to ensure its alignment with evolving industry standards and the company's objectives. Semantic versioning will be used when making changes to this SOP. When an update is made, the version number will be incremented according to the scale and significance of the change.
