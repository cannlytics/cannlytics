# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Data Collection

## Purpose

As an organization, Cannlytics is committed to promoting transparency, reproducibility, and verifiability in cannabis data generation and collection. This SOP is designed to ensure the robustness and reliability of the data collected, which in turn bolsters the value and dependability of our app for users.

This SOP provides a comprehensive framework for the systematic collection, validation, processing, and management of data pertaining to the cannabis industry. The SOP is designed to guide and standardize data collection across a range of dimensions, including licenses, lab results, strain data, and sales information.

## Procedure
The procedure for data collection is segmented into four sections, corresponding to the four dimensions of data being collected.

## Scope

The SOP applies to all personnel involved in the data collection process within our organization. The key components of data to be collected include:

- Cannabis Licenses
- Cannabis Lab Results
- Cannabis Strains
- Cannabis Sales

## Roles and Responsibilities

The Data Collection Team will be responsible for adhering to this SOP. A team lead will oversee the process, ensuring that the collection follows the schedules and guidelines outlined in this document.

## Procedure

1. Cannabis Licenses

1.1 All US Licenses:

The team will collect data on all US cannabis licenses on a weekly basis.
The data sources to be utilized include regulatory bodies, online databases, and other reliable industry sources.
Data collection will occur every Monday and will cover any updates from the previous week.

1.2 International Licenses:

Data on international cannabis licenses will be collected annually.
The collection will occur during the first week of January, covering updates from the previous year.
Reliable international databases, global regulatory bodies, and industry sources will be utilized for data collection.

2. Cannabis Lab Results

2.1 California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts:

Lab results from these states will be collected on a daily to weekly basis depending on the volume and availability of data.
Data sources will include laboratories, industry databases, and regulatory bodies.

The team will conduct daily checks for new data. If data volume is substantial, collection will occur daily. Otherwise, a weekly collection will take place every Friday.

2.2 Washington:

Lab results from Washington will be collected on a monthly basis.
Data collection will occur on the first day of each month.
Data sources will include laboratories, industry databases, and the state's regulatory body.

3. Cannabis Strains

3.1 Based on Lab Results:

Cannabis strains will be curated based on the lab results data.
Strain updates will be scheduled following the lab results updates. If lab results are updated daily, the strain data will also be updated daily. If lab results are updated weekly, strain updates will follow suit.

3.2 Small Dataset of Patents:

A small dataset of patent data related to cannabis strains will be collected monthly.

Collection will occur on the first Monday of each month.

The team will use patent databases and industry sources for this data collection.

4. Cannabis Sales

4.1 By State:

Cannabis sales data will be collected on a monthly basis.
This will occur during the first week of each month, covering the sales of the previous month.

The team will collect data from industry databases, sales platforms, and regulatory reports.

## Data Validation and Quality Check

All collected data must undergo a validation process to ensure accuracy and reliability.

The team will cross-check the data against multiple sources.
Any discrepancies found should be flagged for further investigation.

## Data Management

All data will be stored in secure, encrypted databases.
The team must ensure that data storage and handling adhere to all relevant laws and company privacy policies.

## Training

Those responsible for data collection should be thoroughly trained in these procedures and the specific tools and databases used. They should review this SOP periodically and demonstrate proficiency in data collection, validation, and management before undertaking these tasks.

## Review

This SOP will be reviewed annually to ensure it remains up-to-date and aligned with current industry standards and company goals. Any changes to the procedure will be communicated to all relevant personnel.
