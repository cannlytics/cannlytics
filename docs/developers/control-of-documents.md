## Introduction

**Control of Documents**, SOP-0001, defines how Cannlytics standard operating procedure (SOP) documents are best created, stored, accessed, and used. This document is reviewed and approved by the Cannlytics admin and should be read by anyone writing standard operating procedures (SOPs).

## Purpose

Cannlytics believes that open-source software provides major value to people generating cannabis data, such as laboratories, because:

1. Methods, measurements, and data are verifiable and reproducible.
2. Data generation and collection processes are traceable and transparent.
3. Data generation mechanisms, data quality, quality control, statistical analysis, interpretation, and validation of data can be improved by anyone in the world.

This **Control of Documents** is the first standard operating procedure (SOP), SOP-0001, to provide clear guidance and instructions to aid in the verifiability, reproducibility, and standardization of cannabis data generation and collection.

## Procedure

After copying this document, SOP-0001, as a template and editing appropriate fields, the following steps outline how to create a new standard operating procedure (SOP).

1. Define the users and present the process description with appropriate detail.
2. Describe the task in detail.
      - Break the process into sections.
      - Break the sections into specific steps.
      - Number the steps or add bullet points for clarity.
3. Specify any tools that are required or helpful for the task, such as examples, data, tools, and references.
4. Specify reviewers and approvers and plan appropriate maintenance of the document.
5. Publish the SOP, preferably with the Cannlytics documentation.

Generally, SOPs should be written in markdown so that they can be rendered in HTML or LaTeX. It is best for general SOPs to be reviewed at least annually. When changes are made, versions should be [semantically](https://semver.org/) incremented.

## Training

It is essential for anyone performing a procedure to periodically read, and ideally train and test, the corresponding standard operating procedure. Adequate training should be demonstrated before performing a procedure if possible and reasonable.
