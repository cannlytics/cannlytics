This research can be informed by the existing literature regarding tobacco and alcohol, which highlights the impact of spatial access to tobacco and alcohol retailers and exposure to tobacco and alcohol marketing on smoking and drinking among youth and young adults. Prior research indicates that tobacco and alcohol retailers, as well as medical marijuana dispensaries, are disproportionately located in neighborhoods characterized by socioeconomic disadvantage and by higher proportions of racial/ethnic minorities and young adults. Moreover, retail marketing or point-of-sale practices may differentially target subpopulations and differ by neighborhood demography and local policy. This literature and the methods employed for studying the tobacco and alcohol market could inform research on the retail environment for marijuana, as current gaps exist. In particular, much of the existing literature involves cross-sectional research designs; longitudinal studies are needed. Moreover, standardized measures are needed for systematic monitoring of industry marketing practices and to conduct research examining neighborhood differences in exposure to retail marketing for marijuana and its contribution to use modality and frequency, alone and in combination with nicotine and alcohol. The use of standardized measures for tobacco and alcohol marketing have been critical to develop an evidence base from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that document the impact of retail marketing on substance use by adolescents and adults. Similar research is needed to establish an evidence base to inform federal, state, and local regulations of marijuana.}

  abstract = { Several key questions in bundling have not been empirically examined in marketing: Is mixed bundling more effective than pure bundling or pure components? Does correlation in consumer valuations make bundling more or less effective? Does bundling serve as a complement or substitute to network effects? To address these questions, we develop a consumer-choice model from microfoundations to capture the essentials of our setting, the handheld video game market. We provide a framework to understand the dynamic, long-term effects of bundling on demand. The primary explanation for the profitability of bundling relies on homogenization of consumer valuations for the bundle, allowing the firm to extract more surplus. We find that bundling can be effective through a novel and previously unexamined mechanism of dynamic consumer segmentation, which operates independent of the homogenization effect, and can in fact be stronger when the homogenization effect is weaker. We also find that bundles are treated as separate products (distinct from component products) by consumers. Sales of both hardware and software components decrease in the absence of bundling, and consumers who had previously purchased bundles might delay purchases, resulting in lower revenues. We also find that mixed bundling dominates pure bundling and pure components in terms of both hardware and software revenues. Investigating the link between bundling and indirect network effects, we find that they act as substitute strategies, with a lower relative effectiveness for bundling when network effects are stronger. }

Comparisons to currently controlled substances such as alcohol and tobacco are helpful but incomplete, as consumers use and distribute cannabis differently than these products, and these products have a different physical and psychological impact on consumers. As a result, states have taken diverse approaches with regard to medicinal and recreational cannabis legalization. The current public policy regarding cannabis legalization lacks a clear framework and can be uniquely informed by marketing and public policy researchers. The purpose of this article is to provide a solid starting place for these conversations and to offer ideas about scholarly efforts and research opportunities.}

abstract = {Beyond the hype of Big Data, something within business intelligence projects is indeed changing. This is mainly because Big Data is not only about data, but also about a complete conceptual and technological stack including raw and processed data, storage, ways of managing data, processing and analytics. A challenge that becomes even trickier is the management of the quality of the data in Big Data environments. More than ever before the need for assessing the Quality-in-Use gains importance since the real contribution–business value–of data can be only estimated in its context of use. Although there exists different Data Quality models for assessing the quality of regular data, none of them has been adapted to Big Data. To fill this gap, we propose the “3As Data Quality-in-Use model”, which is composed of three Data Quality characteristics for assessing the levels of Data Quality-in-Use in Big Data projects: Contextual Adequacy, Operational Adequacy and Temporal Adequacy. The model can be integrated into any sort of Big Data project, as it is independent of any pre-conditions or technologies. The paper shows the way to use the model with a working example. The model accomplishes every challenge related to Data Quality program aimed for Big Data. The main conclusion is that the model can be used as an appropriate way to obtain the Quality-in-Use levels of the input data of the Big Data analysis, and those levels can be understood as indicators of trustworthiness and soundness of the results of the Big Data analysis.}

A ubiquitous and important retailing segment is grocery stores, yet almost no analytical work in the block design can be found in the literature. This paper uses a data-driven approach coupled with optimization to address block layout in grocery stores with the participation of Migros, the largest retailer in Turkey. The goal is to develop an effective analytical method for solving realistic grocery store block layout problems considering data which describes revenue generation and adjacency of departments. Historic market basket data is used to characterize certain important aspects that relate to customer sales and these are used in a tabu search meta-heuristic to find layouts which are likely to enhance revenue. To consider the objectives of revenue and adjacency simultaneously, a bi-objective approach is used. A set of non-dominated designs is generated for a decision maker to consider further and the generated designs have been validated with a detailed stochastic simulation model and by the marketing experts at Migros. According to the computational results and the feedback from the industry partner, this approach is both effective and pragmatic for a data-driven, analytic design of grocery store block layouts. Layout designs which improve revenues and desired adjacencies relative to the existing store layouts are identified. While this paper focuses on a single retailer, the approach is general and given that grocery layout is similar worldwide, the method and results should be easily translatable to other retailers.}

Applying these association rules, guests responded favorably to servers’ menu suggestions in roughly two out of three cases when the guest was “undecided” or “without preference.” This article’s chief purpose is to introduce the application of Excel that would otherwise require tedious computation if a restaurateur were to attempt it.}

abstract = {In text books as well as in the business literature, market basket analysis is often promoted as a means to obtain product associations to base a retailer's promotion strategy on. They argue that associated products with a high lift/interest can be promoted effectively by only discounting just one of the two products. Implicitly, they argue that market basket analysis automatically identifies complements. In this research, we show that this implicit assumption does not hold. Our empirical analysis reveals that market basket analysis identifies as many substitutes as complements. Therefore, market basket analysis cannot be used to build a promotion expert system for retailers. Instead, we advice to base the promotion strategy on cross-price elasticities. We conduct this research using scanner data of a large European retailer. Multivariate time-series techniques are used to identify both short-run as well as long-run (persistent) effects of promotions.}

  abstract = { Product affinity segmentation discovers groups of customers with similar purchase preferences for cross-selling opportunities to increase sales and customer loyalty. However, this concept can be challenging to implement efficiently and effectively for actionable strategies. First, the nature of skewed and sparse product-level data in the clustering process results in less meaningful solutions. Second, customer segmentation becomes challenging on massive data sets due to the computational complexity of traditional clustering methods. Third, market basket analysis may suffer from association rules too general to be relevant for important segments. In this article, we propose to partition customers into groups with their product purchase similarity maximized by detecting communities in the customer–product bipartite graph using the Louvain algorithm. Through a case study using data from a large U.S. retailer, we demonstrate that the proposed method generates interpretable clustering results with distinct product purchase patterns. Comprehensive characteristics of customers and products in each cluster can be inferred with statistical significance since they are essentially driven by products purchased by customers. Compared with the conventional RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) model, the proposed approach leads to higher response rates in the recommendation of products to customers in the same cluster. Our analysis provides greater insights into customer purchase behaviors, improves product recommendation effectiveness, and addresses computational complexity in the context of skewed and sparse big data. }

In this paper we consider publicly available disaggregated electrical energy data obtained from six homes. Using the Apriori algorithm we determine association rules between appliances so as to understand which appliances are used in conjunction with others. This information can then be used to determine better ways to control the on/off, activity of these devices. Our objective was to determine if such associations can in fact be determined. We conclude that this is indeed the case as demonstrated by our results. In general, houses with a large number of appliances generated more association rules while the accuracy of classifying rules reduced with an increase in the number of appliances.},

abstract = {When planning and implementing their price-promotions strategy, retail chain managers face the typical dilemma of “thinking globally, but acting locally.” In other words, they must plan their strategy, keeping in mind the global chain-level impact of their promotions, to deliver on the commitments made to manufacturers. At the same time, managers need to make sure that the implementation of such strategy takes into account the fact that each store caters to a different market with different needs and responses to marketing programs. Moreover, the retail chain manager must consider not only how the promotion of a brand affects competing brands and total category sales, but also how it could affect sales in other categories. Our proposed model addresses these two important aspects of chain-wide and store-level cross-category analysis. First, our proposed factor-regression model takes store differences and longitudinal market shifts into account, thereby providing the retail chain manager with unbiased global, chain-level estimates. It also provides stable local estimates of cross-category promotion effects at the store level. Second, while allowing this flexibility, our proposed model is parsimonious enough over existing alternatives, making it particularly useful for chain-wide and store-level cross-category analysis. We apply the proposed model to store-level data from one retail chain, comparing it with several competing approaches, and demonstrate that it provides the best balance between flexibility and parsimony. Most importantly, we show that the proposed model provides useful insights regarding cross-category effects at the chain-level, for individual stores, and their patterns across stores.}
