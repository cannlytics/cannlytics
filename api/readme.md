# <img height="32" alt="" src="https://cannlytics.com/static/cannlytics_website/images/logos/cannlytics_calyx_detailed.svg"> Cannlytics API

The Cannlytics API allows users to interface with cannabis data and statistics. Each API endpoints handle authentication, error handling, and identifying the precise logic to perform.

## Getting Started with the Cannlytics API <a name="getting-started"></a>

Getting started making requests to the Cannlytics API can be done in 3 quick steps.

1. First, [create a Cannlytics account](https://cannlytics.com/account/sign-up).
2. Second, [create a Cannlytics API key](https://cannlytics.com/account/api-keys).
3. Third, begin making requests to the Cannlytics API with your API Key in an `Authorization: Bearer <cannlytics_api_key>` header.

You can make requests through the API passing your API key as a bearer token in the authorization header. Below is an example reading an API key from a local `.env` file and requesting 10 public lab results.

=== "Python"

    ```py

    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load your API key.
    load_dotenv('.env')
    API_KEY = os.getenv('CANNLYTICS_API_KEY')

    # Pass your API key through the authorization header as a bearer token.
    HEADERS = {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer %s' % API_KEY,
        'Content-type': 'application/json',
    }
    ```


=== "Node.js"

    ```js
    const axios = require('axios');
    require('dotenv').config();

    // Pass API key through the authorization header as a bearer token.
    const apiKey = process.env.CANNLYTICS_API_KEY;
    const options = {
      headers: { 'Authorization' : `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
    };
    ```

## Data API Endpoints <a name="data-api-endpoints"></a>

You can get all of the open data curated by Cannlytics through the `data` API endpoints described below.

| Endpoint | Methods | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `\data\analyses` | `GET` |   |
| `\data\analytes` | `GET` |   |
| `\data\coas` | `GET` |   |
| `\data\labs` | `GET` | Get the data of labs that test cannabis. Append a URL-escaped `<lab>` or `<lab_license_number>` to query a specific lab. |
| `\data\regulations` | `GET` | Get regulation data for permitted cannabis markets. Append a `<state>` to query regulation data for a specific state. The regulations include the `limits` used in quality control testing. |
| `\data\states` | `GET` | Get data for states that permit adult-use / recreational or medicinal cannabis. Append a `<state>` path to get data for a specific state. |
| `\data\strains` | `GET` | Get data for documented cannabis strains. Append a `<strain_name>` to query a specific strain. | -->

  - [ ] Licensee data.
  - [ ] Patent data.

## Stats API Endpoints <a name="stats-api-endpoints"></a>

You can interface with various statistical models through the `stats` API endpoints listed in the table below. The `stats` API endpoints are clever mechanisms for you to capitalize on state-of-the-line statistics privately in the cloud. 

| Endpoint | Methods | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `\stats\effects` | `GET`, `POST` | Get predicted effects or append `actual` to the path to post actual effects for a particular cannabis strain. You can also query by appending the `<strain>` as a URL-escaped path. |
| `\stats\personality` | `GET`, `POST` | Get the Big 5 personality test questions and rubric. Post your completed test to get the Big 5 personality trait metrics on a 0 to 1 scale. | -->

  - [ ] Patent prediction API
  - [ ] Product recommendations API
