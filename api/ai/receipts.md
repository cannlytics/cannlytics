| `limit` | The maximum number of receipts to return, pass any positive integer. | `?limit=420` |
| `order` | The field to use to order the returned receipts, `date_sold` by default. | `?order=total_price` |
| `desc` | Whether or not to order in descending order, the default is `false`.  | `?desc=true` |
| `product_name` | The desired product name. | `?product_name=skunk` |
| `product_type` | The desired product type. | `?product_type=flower` |
| `date` | The desired date sold. | `?date=2023-04-20` |
| `price` | The desired total price. | `?price=42` |
| `license` | The desired retailer license number. | `?license=123456789012345678901234` |
| `number` | The desired invoice number. | `?number=123456789012345678901234` |

!!! example

    Post receipt files to have the data extracted and returned.
    ```bash
    POST /api/data/receipts
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data
    Authorization: Bearer <token>

    {
      "file": [YOUR_RECEIPT_IMAGE]
    }
    ```

    You can then get parsed receipt data.
    ```bash
    GET /api/data/receipts
    ```

    The data is returned as JSON: 
    ```bash
