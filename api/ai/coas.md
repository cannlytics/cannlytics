# COA Data Extraction API

The `api/data/coas` API endpoint allows users to extract lab results from certificates of analysis (COAs) through PDFs, images that contain QR codes of the COA URL, or directly from the COA URLs. The endpoint also provides functionality to get, query, and delete parsed lab results. Users can pass the COA data in the request body using the following formats:

- PDFs: Users can upload COA PDF files directly as part of the request using the file field. The API supports a maximum of 10 files per request, and each file should not exceed 100 MB in size.
- Images: Users can upload images that contain QR codes of the COA URLs using the file field. The API accepts PNG, JPG, and JPEG image formats.
- URLs: Users can provide COA URLs in the request body using the urls field as an array.

Example request:

```bash
POST /api/data/coas
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "urls": ["https://coa-url-1", "https://coa-url-2"],
  "file": [PDF_FILE_1, PDF_FILE_2, IMAGE_FILE_1, IMAGE_FILE_2]
}
```

Upon successful extraction, the API will return a JSON response with the extracted COA data.
